 ## Godbolt
 ### URL: https://godbolt.org/

 ### Summary:
 Godbolt is an assembly compiler, specifically, it takes code written in other languages and translates it into assembly, with various degrees of Efficiency depending on the language

 ### Key Takeaways:

 Assembly translator
 Each language seems to translate slightly differently despite being the same program
 The compiler also seems to auto-optimize the code instead of doing a direct translation 

 ### Reflections:

 Translated code is difficult to understand due to my lack of experience with Assembly. Each language has various seeming degrees of efficiency, possibly due to things like library imports

 
 ## Visual Transistor level simulation
 ### URL: [https://godbolt.org/](https://cpuvisualsimulator.github.io/)

 ### Summary:

 The visual transistor simulator is a visual representation of a 6502 chip, one of the first mass-market CPUs. Written in Pythjom, this simulator runs at about 55 half-clock steps per second. Due to its nature as a simulator, it is only an approximation and therefore not accurate

 ### Key Takeaways:

It converts Bitmaps into polygon fragments
55 half-clock steps, effectively a 27 Hz clock speed
The simulation runs at different speeds depending on the language

 ### Reflections:

 Even with a visual representation, the architecture is extremely difficult to comprehend as the images are packed and the animation runs far too fast, making it extremely difficult to trace any path.
 Without the layout, the data given is basically impossible to understand
