 ### Summary:
 Godbolt is an assembly compiler, specifically, it takes code written in other languages and translates it into assembly, with various degrees of Efficiency depending on the language

 ### Key Takeaways:

 Assembly translator

 The compiler also seems to auto-optimize the code instead of doing a direct translation 

 ### Reflections:

 Translated code is difficult to understand due to my lack of experience with Assembly. Each language has various seeming degrees of efficiency, possibly due to things like library imports
